# ***Welcome to my Receipts for Lovely Loveseats Repository!***

Hello, world!

This is the repo, for my ***Receipts for Lovely Loveseats*** project, from Codecademy.

In this project, I'll be storing the names, and prices, of a furniture storeâ€™s catalog, in variables. Then, I'll process the total price, and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.

When you're single, is there any reason to purchase furniture, which seats more than one person?!ðŸ¤£

When you're single, isn't a "loveseat" your own chair?!ðŸ¤£

Let me know what you think.

Thanks!
